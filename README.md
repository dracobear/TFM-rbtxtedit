# Terrible File Manager v0.002 (codename chiruno)
please actually never use this as the name says it's a terrible file manager (made in p***on 🤮) that has horrible code  
the update naming is based on touhou characters and if i ever update it it will probably continue being that
## suwako: initial version
has ls, cd, rm and mk, pretty kewl!!!!!!11 (it sucks please kill me)  
kero kero 🐸
## chiruno: v0.002
added unzipping and that's pretty cool as well
